GTD-PHP
 
Version 0.7 (2006-09-30)
A web-based implementation of the Getting Things Done system for personal
organization.

Requirements:
    mysql 
    php
    apache with php enabled

This version does not support installations using table prefixes in the
database. We plan on adding that support in the next release.

UPGRADING

1. You should backup your gtd database with:
    mysqldump gtd > gtdbackup.sql
    (use this in case you need to restore)

2. Extract the tarball into the same directory you originally 
   installed gtd-php in. 

3. Then proceed to step 8 under NEW INSTALLATION. If your current version is
   0.6, your database remains the same, only the forms/interface/functionaly will
   be upgraded. If you are using version 0.5 or older, this script will add
   new tables as well as add new columns to your existing tables. Your
   original data will be upgraded to use the new functionality in version 0.7.
   You do not need to recreate your original database (i.e., step 1 is simply
   a precaution).


NEW INSTALLATION
Installation (Mac OS X-specific. For an other OS, adjust accordingly):

1. Set up mysql and php

2. cd ~/Sites

3. tar -xzvf pathtotarball

4. cd ~/Sites/gtd-php

5. cp config.sample.php config.inc.php

6. Edit config.inc.php and change $pass and $user to values for local machine.

7. In mysql create a database called gtd:
	create database gtd;

    Note that you should also set proper mysql permissions for the mysql user.
    This user should NOT have access to other databases, nor grant privileges;
    this should NOT be the root user.

8. Make sure the name of the database and user that you created in step 7,
   match those in your config file from step 6.

9. Point your browser to http://localhost/~username/gtd-php/install.php

    If you encounter a mysql error "Error connecting to database"
    then connect to mysql from a shell and issue:
    	set password for 'user'@'localhost' = old_password('password');

	being sure to change user to the user in config.inc.php and password to
	the value of pass in config.inc.php
