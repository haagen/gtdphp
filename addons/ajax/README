AJAX addon for gtd 0.9alpha rev 483+
Incorporates jQuery v1.2.3, which is MIT/GPL dual-licensed

Works in Firefox and Safari 3.  Partly tested ok on Konqueror 4

You may find some real problems using this addon in IE:
but as Microsoft make debugging and javascript implementation so difficult,
it's not likely to get fixed soon, by me!
